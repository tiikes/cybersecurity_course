### [ CSP: Wildcard Directive ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10055/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks. Including (but not limited to) Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page â€” covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

* URL: http://localhost:8000
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `content-security-policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; object-src 'none';`
  * Other Info: `The following directives either allow wildcard sources (or ancestors), are not defined, or are overly broadly defined:
frame-ancestors, form-action

The directive(s): frame-ancestors, form-action are among the directives that do not fallback to default-src, missing/excluding them is the same as allowing anything.`
* URL: http://localhost:8000/login
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `content-security-policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; object-src 'none';`
  * Other Info: `The following directives either allow wildcard sources (or ancestors), are not defined, or are overly broadly defined:
frame-ancestors, form-action

The directive(s): frame-ancestors, form-action are among the directives that do not fallback to default-src, missing/excluding them is the same as allowing anything.`
* URL: http://localhost:8000/register
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `content-security-policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; object-src 'none';`
  * Other Info: `The following directives either allow wildcard sources (or ancestors), are not defined, or are overly broadly defined:
frame-ancestors, form-action

The directive(s): frame-ancestors, form-action are among the directives that do not fallback to default-src, missing/excluding them is the same as allowing anything.`

Instances: 3

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is properly configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

#### CWE Id: [ 693 ](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html)


#### WASC Id: 15

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Authentication Request Identified ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10111/)



##### Informational (High)

### Description

The given request has been identified as an authentication request. The 'Other Info' field contains a set of key=value lines which identify any relevant fields. If the request is in a context which has an Authentication Method set to "Auto-Detect" then this rule will change the authentication to match the request identified.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/login
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: `username`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `password`
  * Other Info: `userParam=username
userValue=foo-bar@example.com
passwordParam=password
referer=http://localhost:8000/login`

Instances: 1

### Solution

This is an informational alert rather than a vulnerability and so there is nothing to fix.
